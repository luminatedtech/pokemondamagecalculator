So everyone has heard about Pokemon but many do not know about the many subtle aspects about the game.

All pokemon have a unique type. Each pokemon will have either 1 or 2 types. Certain types are strong against others while others are weak. Some common ones are that water types are strong against fire types while they are weak against grass types. 

Pokemon can use moves to damage opposing pokemon. The moves also have a type and is what determines if a move will be effective or not aganst the opposing pokemon. 

As someone who has played pokemon throughout his childhood, I came back to find that the game has changed and new types have been added in. Unaware of the new type changes, I realized that I wasn't sure which move I should use to deal the most damage.

With a whopping 18 types and 171 type combinations a pokemon can be, the myriad of scenarios are in the air. As someone who cannot remember the type chart to heart, I created an app I use while playing competitive pokemon. 

In this app, I have created a Pokemon Damage Calculator. 

It's very simple:
1. Type in the pokemon you would like to attack in the first column
    This will list the Pokemon's type and a sprite of its front view
2. Type in the move you would like to attack with
    This will list the move's type and it's base damage
3. On the last column, it will return the new damage based on the targeted pokemon's typing. 

This does not take into account more advanced calculations such as critical strike chance, same type attack bonus, and other factors, but I hope to eventually add those functions. 

Thank you and enjoy!
